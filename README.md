I Created a Contact ListView UI in Android!
Hey everyone! 🎉 I just designed a Contact ListView UI in Android, and it’s working perfectly! 💯

📌 Here’s How I Structured It:
🔹 Contact Model – Stores the contact’s name and phone number.
🔹 Custom Adapter – Formats and displays each contact in the ListView.
🔹 Activity with ListView – Loads and displays the list dynamically.

🎨 UI Features:
✔️ Clean and simple ListView layout
✔️ Each item shows name & phone number
✔️ Smooth scrolling with a custom adapter
